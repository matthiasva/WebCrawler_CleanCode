# WebCrawler_CleanCode

Build: Everything needed should be included in the files of the master branch. (WebCrawler.java + build.gradle for dependencies)

Run: When you start the crawler it asks for the URL, depth, source and target language.
The languages must be in the formant: "en" f√ºr english, "es" for spanish.
I'm using a free online tranlsation service which doesn't include german sadly.

It saves the output in the output.md file.

All the test cases are in the WebCrawlerTest.java class.
